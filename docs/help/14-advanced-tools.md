# Advanced tools

Graphion can integrate with several external tools to handle problem documents, validate output, generate alt text with AI, and submit to OJS. **All are optional.** Missing tools degrade gracefully — the corresponding buttons in the UI become disabled with an "install X to enable" hint. No installation is required to use Graphion's core pipeline.

## DOCX-side preprocessors

### Mammoth — alternate DOCX reader

When to use: text-box-heavy documents, complex tables, anything where Pandoc's output looks broken.

```bash
pip install mammoth
```

After install, the **upload form** shows a radio button: *Pandoc (default)* vs *Mammoth*. Pick Mammoth for documents that Pandoc mangles.

Mammoth converts DOCX → HTML internally, then we pipe that HTML through Pandoc to get Markdown. The HTML intermediate is saved as `article-mammoth.html` in the article directory for inspection.

### LibreOffice — DOCX normalization

When to use: documents saved by old Word versions, documents with weird autoformatting, anything where you want a clean re-save before ingest.

Install LibreOffice from <https://www.libreoffice.org/>. The `soffice` binary must be on your PATH (Windows installers add it automatically to `C:\Program Files\LibreOffice\program\`).

After install, the **upload form** shows a checkbox: *Round-trip through LibreOffice before ingest*. Check it to apply.

The normalization opens your DOCX in LibreOffice headless and re-saves it. The round-trip flattens many Word quirks: text boxes get incorporated into the document flow, autoformat junk is cleaned out, broken style references resolve.

### DOCX structural scan

Always runs; no install needed. At upload time, Graphion uses `python-docx` to inspect your DOCX and flash warnings about:

- Text boxes present
- Tables with merged cells, > 6 columns, or nested tables
- Images missing alt text
- Tracked changes left in the document

The warnings don't block upload — they're informational so you know what to expect.

## Alternate PDF rendering

### WeasyPrint

When to use: you want the PDF to look exactly like the HTML galley (same CSS, same fonts, same layout).

```bash
pip install weasyprint
```

WeasyPrint also needs native libraries — `cairo`, `pango`, `gdk-pixbuf`. On Windows, the WeasyPrint installer or [MSYS2 bundles](https://doc.courtbouillon.org/weasyprint/stable/first_steps.html#windows) include them. On macOS: `brew install cairo pango gdk-pixbuf`. On Linux: `apt install python3-cffi libpango-1.0-0 libpangoft2-1.0-0`.

After install, the article page shows a *Render PDF (WeasyPrint)* button in the Advanced section. Output is written to `article-weasy.pdf` so it doesn't clobber the Typst-rendered `article.pdf`. The Typst path remains the default.

**Trade-offs**: WeasyPrint = HTML/PDF parity but less typographic refinement (no drop caps, weaker hyphenation, no tagged-PDF accessibility metadata). Typst = print-grade typography but separate template, possible HTML/PDF drift.

## Accessibility validation

### verapdf — PDF/UA-1 compliance

Validates whether `article.pdf` meets the PDF/UA-1 formal accessibility standard. Required by some repositories.

Download from <https://verapdf.org/>. Add `verapdf` (the wrapper script) to your PATH.

Article page → Advanced → *Validate PDF/UA*. Result is flashed and the full JSON report is written to `verapdf-report.json` in the article directory.

### pa11y — HTML accessibility audit

Industry-standard HTML accessibility tester (used by BBC, GOV.UK, etc.).

```bash
npm install -g pa11y
```

(Requires Node.js.) Article page → Advanced → *Audit HTML accessibility*. Output: number of errors and warnings, full report in `pa11y-report.json`.

## AI-assisted cleanup

### Claude — Stylize article (one-button editorial polish)

The most useful AI feature in Graphion. **Article page → Advanced → Stylize article ★** sends your article body plus the journal's style guide to Claude in a single call. Claude applies every editorial convention in one pass:

- Splits run-on Works Cited entries into proper paragraphs
- Strips Microsoft Office HTML cruft (`<span style="mso-...">`)
- Normalizes quotes (curly), dashes (en for ranges, em for breaks), ellipses
- Repairs broken tables (collapsed-on-one-line, blank-lines-between-rows)
- Converts Pandoc Div-style footnotes to canonical `[^N]:` syntax
- Removes Pandoc HTML round-trip artifacts (`[?](#footnote-ref-N)` back-arrows, stray pipe characters)
- Restructures heading levels per the journal's convention
- Tightens paragraph structure (no doubled blanks, blank line around headings)

**How to customize per journal:** edit the file at `content/journals/<slug>/template/style-guide.md`. The default LiCS style guide ships with the repo. The guide is a plain Markdown file describing your editorial conventions — Claude reads it as context. You can:

- Change Works Cited format (MLA, APA, Chicago)
- Specify heading levels and capitalization
- Override quote / dash / ellipsis preferences
- Tell Claude what to fix and what to preserve

**Cost:** approximately $0.02–$0.05 per article (Haiku 4.5 pricing as of April 2026). The full article body is sent; Claude returns the rewritten body. The YAML front matter is preserved separately (never touched).

**Safety:** the original `article.md` is snapshotted to `.versions/` before the rewrite. If Claude misbehaves, use the **Snapshots** view to diff and restore.

**What it preserves:** the author's voice and word choice — Claude is explicitly instructed to never paraphrase or invent. Citations, URLs, footnote markers, block-quote contents are all kept verbatim.

### Claude (alt-text generation)

When to use: your article has images without alt text and you want concrete descriptions auto-generated.

```bash
pip install anthropic
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-…
```

(Get a key from <https://console.anthropic.com/>.) Restart the Flask app for the env var to apply.

Article page → Advanced → *Generate alt text (Claude)*. Graphion finds every `![](path)` in `article.md` with an empty alt field, sends the image to Claude vision, and writes the returned 1–2-sentence description back into the Markdown. Re-render to apply.

Cost: typically a few cents per article. Each image is one short API call.

The Claude integration also exposes `llm_cleanup.repair_mangled_table()` and `llm_cleanup.polish_paragraph()` as Python helpers — useful for scripted batch cleanups. Not yet wired to UI buttons.

## OCR for tables-as-images

### Tesseract

When to use: an author pasted a screenshot of a table from Excel/Sheets/etc. and you want to recover the text.

```bash
# Python wrapper:
pip install pytesseract Pillow
# Tesseract CLI (separate install):
#   Windows: https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki
#   macOS:   brew install tesseract
#   Linux:   apt install tesseract-ocr
```

Article page → Advanced → *OCR images (Tesseract)*. Graphion walks the article's `assets/` directory, OCRs every image, and writes the recognized text to `ocr-results.txt` per-image. Copy any tables from there into `article.md` as Markdown pipe tables.

`ocr.ocr_to_markdown_table(path)` is also available as a Python helper for one-shot table reconstruction (heuristic, works best for clean screenshots).

## OJS REST API integration

Direct galley submission to an OJS journal — closes the "download zip, log into OJS, upload, configure" loop.

Configure two env vars (or per-journal DB fields, planned):

```bash
export OJS_URL=https://your-ojs-site.org/index.php/your-journal/api/v1
export OJS_API_TOKEN=…   # generated in your OJS user profile
```

The `ojs_client` Python module exposes `upload_galley()` and `list_submissions()`. UI integration on the article page is currently a TODO; the module is callable from a Python REPL or a custom script.

OJS REST API surface evolves between versions; the client is built to be easy to patch. See `ojs_client.py` for endpoint paths used.

## Verifying what's installed

The article page's *Advanced* section shows each button greyed-out when its underlying tool isn't found, with a hover tooltip explaining what to install. The probes are cheap (no actual API calls), so the page renders quickly even when checking all five.

You can also check from a Python REPL:

```python
import preprocessors, validators, llm_cleanup, ocr, conversion
print(preprocessors.mammoth_available())
print(preprocessors.libreoffice_available())
print(conversion.weasyprint_available())
print(validators.verapdf_available())
print(validators.pa11y_available())
print(llm_cleanup.available())
print(ocr.available())
```
